please also specify the linear and angular velocities around 3 axis in the code.
Please only output the completed code for the python function move_robot and do not explain afterwards.
Please also make sure to output linear and angular velocities in 3 axes in the code.
You should actively make the robots explore the environment if the object is not detected at first.
