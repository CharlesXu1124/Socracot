# SocraCoT: A Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning Method for Task Completion (Robotics)

Repository for Socratic CoT Project entitled "Investigating the Effectiveness of a Socratic Chain-of-Thoughts (SocraCoT) Reasoning Method for Task Planning in Robotics"

The objective of SocraCot is to implement the Socratic reasoning strategy described by Chang et al. arXiv:2303.08769(2023) for robotics applications in Webots. More specifically, we deploy SocraCot (Socratic Reasoning + CoT) for the completion of a complex tasks(s) involving Tiago robot in an office setting and evaluate its performance compared to a non-Chain of Thoughts (CoT) reasoning strategy. SocraCot uses Chat-GPT 4o to generate code based sensor inputs with Webots via Ros2 bridge. We demonstrate that a Socratic reasoning strategy can be deployed for effective task completion with zero-shot prompting, and that LLMs are integrable with Webots robotics pipelines.
