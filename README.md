# SocraCot
Repo for Socratic project

The objective of SocraCot is to implement the Socratic reasoning strategy described by Chang et al (2023) for robotics applications in Webots. More specifically, we deploy SocraCot for the completion of a complex tasks(s) involving Tiago robot in an office setting (Webots) and evaluate its performance compared to non-Chain of Thoughts (CoT) reasoning strategies. SocraCot uses Chat-gpt 4o to generate code based on sensor inputs in Webots via Ros2 bridge. We demonstrate that a Socratic reasoning stratgy can be deployed for effective task completion with zero-shot prompting, and that LLMs are integrable with Webots robotics pipelines.
